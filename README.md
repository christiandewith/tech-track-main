# The best Premier League attacker
Welcome to my repository of the best premier league attacker  at this moment 2025/2026. This is the data visualisation I built for the Minor Information Design at the HVA. 

## What is this datavisualisation about?
I'm someone who is very interested in football and I like watching the statistics of players. What especially fascinates me is statistical outliers. that why I made this datavisualisation where you can follow Erling Haaland all year to see how far a head he is of the rest of the premier league attackers. The data I used is goals and assists. These statisctics are shown in a bubblechart with the top 20 premier league attackers based on their amount of goals. 

I made simple list with the players that are on the list and their amount of goals underneath the visualization so you can tell who is on there because sometimes players overlap and you can't tel who is who. 

I also a fixturs table so you can see the most recent result of every team in league. 


## I build this using
- Git
- node
